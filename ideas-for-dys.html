    <h1>Here are some ideas for creating <strong>Dystopian</strong> stories</h1>
      <p>Dystopian worlds can create <strong>intresting</strong> scenarios for your players.
      Like, what do you do when you must make choices for <em>yourself,</em> instead of others?</p>

    <h2>List (<em>and Pics</em>) for Scenarios</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Beginning of the <strong>End</strong> <img src="img/end.jpg" alt="A photo of a World War"></li>
          <p>Great way to introduce the players to your ruined world.</p>
        <li>The <strong><em>New</em></strong> World <img src="img/change.jpg" alt="A photo of a changed world"></li>
          <p>Make the players feel like they are stepping onto an alien world.</p>
        <li>Lost hope <img src="img/dispair.jpg" alt="A photo of sorrow"></li>
          <p>Don't be afraid of making your players feel the dispair of a dead world.
          Just don't make it always feel like that. <em>It is only a game after all.</em></p>
        <li>New <strong>Dangers</strong> <img src="img.beware.jpg" alt="A photo of a monster"></li>
          <p>This is where the worlds of Dystopias thrive. There are new and horrific scenarios for you to use against your players.</p>
