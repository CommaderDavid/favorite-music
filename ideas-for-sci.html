    <h1>Ideas for <strong>Sci-fi</strong> Worlds</h1>
      <p>Sci-fi is a <em>theme</em> that you can use to create worlds entirely <em>unique</em> to your players.</p>

    <h2>Best types of Worlds to make, in order!</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Original</li>
        <img src="img/original.jpg" alt="A photo of an mirrored earth">
          <p>Creating an <em>Original</em> world is a great way to get your players into your game. Having something they never have seen makes each session <em>fresh</em> and <strong>exciting</strong>!</p>
      <li>Future</li>
        <img src="img/future.jpg" alt="A photo of a future city">
          <p><em>Future</em> worlds are a place where many limitations we have are able to be removed for convenience of the players.</p>
      <li>Distiant</li>
        <img src="img/distiant.jpg" alt="A photo of a distiant world">
          <p>Worlds that are distiant can give them a sense of being isolated, and can give the players a somewhat unnerved feeling.</p>
      <li>The Unknown</li>
        <img src="img/unknown.jpg" alt="A photo of a mysterious">
          <p>Creating an unknown universe for your players to play in, <strong>forces them</strong> to try and survive in a world they know nothing about.</p>
    </ol>
